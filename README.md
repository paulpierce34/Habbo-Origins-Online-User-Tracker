# Habbo-Origins-Online-User-Tracker
Powershell script to track online users for Habbo Origins

# HOW TO USE
1.) Git clone (or copy/paste into Powershell ISE)
2.) Run script
3.) Output file will be saved to your documents folder by default

# WHY??
I'm not entirely sure why I made this script. But I'm thinking I will create a scheduled task to run this daily and track online users. I really don't want this game to fail <3
