# Habbo-Origins-User-And-Price-Tracker
Powershell script to track online users and rare furni prices for Habbo Origins.

# HOW TO USE
1.) Git clone (or copy/paste into Powershell ISE)

2.) Run script

3.) Output files (.txt and .csv) will be saved to your documents folder by default

4.) (Optional) There is a Set-ScheduledHabboTask function you can run as admin after executing this script that will register a new scheduled task running at 12:30am everyday. This function assumes the script is saved to your documents folder.

# WHY??
I'm not entirely sure why I made this script. Shoutout to rarevalues.net for creating a pricing API for me when I requested it within an hour. I really don't want this game to fail <3
