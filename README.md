# Habbo-Origins-Online-User-Tracker
Powershell script to track online users for Habbo Origins

# HOW TO USE
1.) Git clone (or copy/paste into Powershell ISE)

2.) Run script

3.) Output files (.txt and .csv) will be saved to your documents folder by default

# WHY??
I'm not entirely sure why I made this script. But I'm thinking I will create a scheduled task to run this daily and track online users. I really don't want this game to fail <3
